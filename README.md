## About

Basics Showcase is a gallery of mini-projects built to refine my understanding of the building blocks of the web. The experiments range from simple static layouts to lightly interactive pieces. The aim is to create a solid foundation before moving into more advanced front-end and full-stack work.

## Project Sources

Many of the projects are inspired by or adapted from challenges on:

- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

- [Dev Challenges](https://devchallenges.io/)


*These platforms offer practical design briefs that support focused implementation practice.*

## Tech Stack

- HTML: semantic structure and accessibility

- CSS: layout, styling, and responsive design

- JavaScript: DOM manipulation and interactivity

**Project-specific: Netlify for secure API handling**

## Structure

Each project is contained in its own folder and typically includes:

- index.html

- styles.css

- script.js (depending on the project)

*The showcase site links to these projects and presents them in a simple, easy-to-navigate layout.*
