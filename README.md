## About

Basics Showcase is a gallery of mini-projects built to refine my understanding of the building blocks of the web. The experiments range from simple static layouts to lightly interactive pieces. The aim is to create a solid foundation before moving into more advanced front-end and full-stack work.

## Project Sources

Many of the projects are inspired by or adapted from challenges on:

Frontend Mentor — https://www.frontendmentor.io/

Dev Challenges — https://devchallenges.io/


**These platforms offer practical design briefs that support focused implementation practice.**

## Tech Stack

HTML5 – semantic structure and accessibility

CSS3 – layout, styling, and responsive design

JavaScript (ES6+) – DOM manipulation and interactivity

## Structure

Each project is contained in its own folder and typically includes:

index.html

styles.css

script.js (depending on the project)

**The showcase site links to these projects and presents them in a simple, easy-to-navigate layout.**
